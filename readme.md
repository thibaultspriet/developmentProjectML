# Development project in Machine Learning

This is a machine learning project developed for a project at IMT Atlantique. This is a final project of a course entitled **Introduction to Theory and Practice of machine learning**.

## About the project ‚ùì

The main idea of this project was to develop a workflow of machine learning algorithms that can be applied on different datasets. This workflow had to implement **general** functions in order to preprocess the dataset, train a model and analyze the results.

## Datasets üìñ

We worked on two different well known datasets :

* [Kidney Disease](https://github.com/thibaultspriet/developmentProjectML/blob/master/kidney_disease.csv) 
* [Banknote](https://github.com/thibaultspriet/developmentProjectML/blob/master/data_banknote_authentication.txt)

The two datasets are different in many ways (number of features, types of features ...).

## What we did üíª

For this project we implement functions for these goals : 

* prepare / clean datasets
* split the datasets into training / testing
* apply PCA
* train models
* cross validate models
* test models
* Analyze performances. 

Finally we implement these different machine learning algorithms :

* SVM (support vector machine)
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Forest

We chose [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to build our models.

## Prerequisites

If you want to run are use this project you will nedd :

* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, ScikitLearn

And of course some basis on Machine Learning
